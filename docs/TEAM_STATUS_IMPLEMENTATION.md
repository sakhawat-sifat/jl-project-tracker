# Team Member Status & Project Filtering - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 5, 2025

## Overview
Added status field for team members and implemented filtering logic to:
1. Allow editing team member status (active/inactive)
2. Show only active team members in allocation dropdowns
3. Hide completed projects from allocation dropdowns

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions

#### types/index.ts
- ✅ Added `status?: 'active' | 'inactive'` field to `TeamMember` interface

### 2. Database Type Definitions

#### lib/supabase.ts
- ✅ Added `status: 'active' | 'inactive'` to `team_members.Row`
- ✅ Added `status?: 'active' | 'inactive'` to `team_members.Insert`
- ✅ Added `status?: 'active' | 'inactive'` to `team_members.Update`

### 3. Service Layer

#### supabaseService.ts

**getTeamMembers():**
- ✅ Added status field to mapping with default value 'active'
- ✅ Returns: `status: member.status || 'active'`

**addTeamMember():**
- ✅ Includes status in insert with default 'active'
- ✅ Inserts: `status: memberData.status || 'active'`

**updateTeamMember():**
- ✅ Includes status in update with default 'active'
- ✅ Updates: `status: memberData.status || 'active'`

### 4. Team Member Management Component

#### TeamMemberManagement.tsx

**Form State:**
- ✅ Added `status: 'active' as 'active' | 'inactive'` to formData state
- ✅ Updated resetForm() to set default status to 'active'
- ✅ Updated handleEdit() to load member's status

**UI Changes:**
- ✅ Added status dropdown in edit mode only
- ✅ Status options: Active / Inactive
- ✅ Added visual indicators for inactive members:
  - Gray avatar instead of indigo
  - "Inactive" badge next to name
  - Reduced opacity (60%) for entire card

**Form Field (shown only when editing):**
```tsx
{editingMember && (
  <div>
    <label>Status</label>
    <select value={formData.status}>
      <option value="active">Active</option>
      <option value="inactive">Inactive</option>
    </select>
  </div>
)}
```

### 5. Allocation Form Component

#### AllocationForm.tsx

**Filtering Logic:**
- ✅ Added `activeTeamMembers` filter: `teamMembers.filter(member => member.status !== 'inactive')`
- ✅ Added `availableProjects` filter: `projects.filter(project => project.status !== 'Completed')`
- ✅ Team member dropdown now only shows active members
- ✅ Project dropdown now excludes completed projects

**Key Changes:**
```tsx
const activeTeamMembers = teamMembers.filter(member => member.status !== 'inactive');
const availableProjects = projects.filter(project => project.status !== 'Completed');
```

## Database Migration

### Migration Files Created:

1. **supabase/migrations/20251005000001_add_team_member_status.sql**
   - Adds status column to team_members table
   - Sets default value to 'active'
   - Adds CHECK constraint: `status IN ('active', 'inactive')`
   - Updates existing members to 'active' status

2. **add_team_member_status.sql** (root directory)
   - Simple SQL for manual execution in Supabase dashboard

### SQL to Execute:

```sql
-- Add status column to team_members table
ALTER TABLE team_members 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status text DEFAULT 'active' 
CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive'));

-- Update existing team members to have 'active' status
UPDATE team_members SET status = 'active' WHERE status IS NULL;
```

## How to Apply Database Changes

### Method 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `add_team_member_status.sql` from the project root
4. Copy and paste the SQL into the editor
5. Click **"Run"** to execute

### Method 2: Using Supabase CLI (if configured)

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
npx supabase db push
```

---

## Feature Behavior

### 1. Adding New Team Member
- Default status: **Active**
- Status field is **not shown** in the add form
- Member is automatically created with active status

### 2. Editing Team Member
- Status dropdown **appears only in edit mode**
- Admin can change status between Active/Inactive
- Options: Active | Inactive

### 3. Team Member Display
**Active Members:**
- Normal appearance
- Indigo avatar background
- No status badge

**Inactive Members:**
- 60% opacity
- Gray avatar background
- "Inactive" badge displayed next to name

### 4. Allocation Dropdown Filtering

**Team Member Dropdown:**
- ✅ Shows only active members
- ❌ Inactive members are hidden

**Project Dropdown:**
- ✅ Shows all projects except completed ones
- ❌ Projects with status "Completed" are hidden

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Team Member Management
- [ ] Add new team member (should default to active)
- [ ] Edit team member and change status to inactive
- [ ] Verify inactive member shows "Inactive" badge
- [ ] Verify inactive member has gray avatar
- [ ] Edit inactive member and change back to active

### ✅ Allocation Form
- [ ] Open allocation form
- [ ] Verify team member dropdown shows only active members
- [ ] Verify project dropdown doesn't show completed projects
- [ ] Create allocation with active member and non-completed project
- [ ] Verify allocation is created successfully

### ✅ Database
- [ ] Run SQL migration in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Verify status column exists in team_members table
- [ ] Verify existing members have status = 'active'
- [ ] Test updating member status via UI
- [ ] Verify status persists in database

3. `/src/services/supabaseService.ts` - Added status handling in CRUD operations
4. `/src/components/TeamMemberManagement.tsx` - Added status UI and logic
5. `/src/components/AllocationForm.tsx` - Added filtering for dropdowns

## Files Created

1. `/supabase/migrations/20251005000001_add_team_member_status.sql` - Migration file
2. `/add_team_member_status.sql` - Manual SQL file for Supabase dashboard

---

## Status

✅ **Frontend changes**: Complete and implemented
✅ **Type definitions**: Updated
✅ **Service layer**: Updated with status handling
✅ **UI enhancements**: Status indicators and filtering added
⏳ **Database migration**: Needs to be executed in Supabase dashboard

---

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database migration** by running the SQL in Supabase dashboard
2. Test adding a new team member (should default to active)
3. Test editing a team member and changing status to inactive
4. Verify allocation form only shows active members
5. Verify allocation form doesn't show completed projects
6. Test creating allocations with the filtered dropdowns

---

## Additional Notes

- Team members with inactive status remain in the database but are hidden from allocation dropdowns
- Completed projects remain in the database but are hidden from allocation dropdowns
- Existing allocations for inactive members or completed projects remain unchanged
- Admins can view all members (both active and inactive) in the Team Management section
- The status can be toggled back and forth as needed
