## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Status field doesn't appear when editing
**Solution:** Make sure you're clicking Edit on an existing member, not adding a new one

### Issue: Inactive members still appear in allocation dropdown
**Solution:** 
1. Check if the member's status is actually set to "inactive" in the database
2. Refresh the page to reload data
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Status doesn't persist after save
**Solution:**
1. Verify the SQL migration was run successfully
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Verify the `status` column exists in `team_members` table

---

## üìä Verification Queries (Optional)

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check if status column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'team_members' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- View all team members with their status
SELECT id, name, role, status 
FROM team_members 
ORDER BY name;

-- Count active vs inactive members
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM team_members 
GROUP BY status;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All features are working correctly if:

- ‚úÖ New members default to "active" status
- ‚úÖ Status dropdown only appears when editing (not when adding)
- ‚úÖ Inactive members have visual indicators (gray, badge, faded)
- ‚úÖ Allocation form only shows active members
- ‚úÖ Allocation form doesn't show completed projects
- ‚úÖ Status changes persist after page reload
- ‚úÖ Status can be toggled between active/inactive

---

- Mark team members as inactive when they leave or are on extended leave
- Keep your allocation dropdowns clean with only active members
- Maintain a complete history while hiding inactive members from day-to-day operations
- Easily reactivate members when needed
